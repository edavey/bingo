# Bingo

## Dependencies

- Ruby. You can edit the Gemfile if you want to run the program with a different version of Ruby.

- Highline gem. Run `bundle install` to install this (and `pry` which I use to debug in development)

## Usage

- Make sure `bingo` is executable (`chmod +x bingo`)

- Follow the instructions given by Highline to choose how many balls you want in your game, and then draw random balls at will.
